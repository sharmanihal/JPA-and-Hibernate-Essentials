# Using Parameters in JPQL Queries

When working with JPA, it's crucial to avoid string concatenation to insert dynamic values into queries. String concatenation can lead to potential security risks, such as SQL injection, where malicious input could manipulate your query and harm your database.

## Example: Fetch Employees Older Than 20

### **Incorrect Approach (String Concatenation)**
A common but insecure approach might look like this:

```java
int age = 20;
TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createQuery(
        "select e from Employee e where e.age >" + age, Employee.class);
List<Employee> resultList = query.getResultList();
resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

**Problem:** This approach exposes the query to SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could manipulate the `age` value to run malicious SQL queries.

Say if we were using `String age = "25"` an attacker can manipulate the value of this string and pass something like : `String age="25;DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE_DATA"`

### **Secure Approach (Using Parameters)**
To prevent SQL injection, use named parameters in JPQL. Here's how you can safely insert dynamic values into your queries:

```java
int age = 25;
TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createQuery(
        "select e from Employee e where e.age > :minAge", Employee.class);

query.setParameter("minAge", age);
List<Employee> resultList = query.getResultList();
resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Named Parameters**: The query uses `:minAge` as a placeholder for the parameter. 
- **Setting Parameters**: The `setParameter` method is used to safely bind the `age` variable to the `minAge` parameter in the query.
- **Security**: This approach avoids SQL injection by ensuring the dynamic value is properly escaped and handled by JPA.
