# Using Named Queries in JPA

Named Queries are a powerful feature in JPA that allow you to define frequently used queries directly within your entity class. They help organize your queries and make your code cleaner and more reusable.

We can have multiple annotations of @NamedQuery on top of a single entity.

## Steps to Define and Use Named Queries

### 1. Define the Named Query in the Entity Class
To define a named query, you use the `@NamedQuery` annotation inside your entity class. This query can be reused throughout your application.

#### Example: Named Query for Sorting Employees by Name

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "EMPLOYEE_DATA")
@NamedQuery(query = "SELECT e FROM Employee e ORDER BY e.name", name = "emp_name_asc")
public class Employee {
    // Entity fields and methods
}
```

- `query`: The JPQL query that will be executed.
- `name`: A unique name for the query that can be used to refer to the query later.

### 2. Using Named Query in Code

Once the named query is defined, you can use it anywhere in your code to execute the query.

#### Example: Using the Named Query to Get Employees Sorted by Name

```java
TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createNamedQuery("emp_name_asc", Employee.class);
List<Employee> resultList = query.getResultList();
resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

### 3. Using Parameters in Named Queries

You can also define parameters in your named queries and set them when executing the query.

#### Example: Named Query with Parameters

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "EMPLOYEE_DATA")
@NamedQuery(query = "SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.age > :minAge ORDER BY e.name", name = "emp_name_by_age")
public class Employee {
    // Entity fields and methods
}
```

- `:minAge` is a placeholder for the parameter to be passed into the query.

#### Example: Setting Parameters for the Named Query

```java
int age = 20;
TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createNamedQuery("emp_name_by_age", Employee.class);
query.setParameter("minAge", age);
List<Employee> resultList = query.getResultList();
resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Benefits of Named Queries

- **Reusability**: Named queries are defined once and can be used across the application.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Queries are kept separate from business logic, making the code cleaner.
- **Performance**: Named queries are pre-compiled by the JPA provider, which can improve performance in some cases.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to a query only need to be made in one place, making the code easier to maintain.
