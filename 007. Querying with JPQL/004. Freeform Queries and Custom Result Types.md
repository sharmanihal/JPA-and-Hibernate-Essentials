In cases where the result of a query is not necessarily an entity but rather a subset of data or even a combination of different data types, JPQL allows you to fetch only the specific data you need. This can help optimize performance by reducing the amount of unnecessary data retrieval.

### Example 1: Fetching Specific Columns (Only Employee Names)

If you only need a subset of the entity data, such as just the names of employees, you can specify the exact field you want to retrieve. This avoids fetching all the data related to the employee entity.

#### Example Code:
```java
TypedQuery<String> query = entityManager.createQuery(
    "select e.name from Employee e", String.class);
List<String> resultList = query.getResultList();

resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

In this query:
- We're selecting only the `name` field from the `Employee` entity.
- The return type is `String.class` since we're fetching only the names.
- This is more efficient than retrieving the entire `Employee` entity if you're only interested in the `name` field.

### Example 2: Fetching Multiple Fields (Name and Date of Birth)

If you need more than one field from the entity, you can select multiple fields, and JPQL will return the results as an `Object[]`, where each element corresponds to a selected field.

#### Example Code:
```java
TypedQuery<Object[]> query = entityManager.createQuery(
    "select e.name, e.dob from Employee e", Object[].class);
List<Object[]> resultList = query.getResultList();

resultList.forEach(x -> {
    System.out.println(x[0]); // Employee name
    System.out.println(x[1]); // Employee date of birth
});
```

Here:
- We are selecting `name` and `dob` fields from the `Employee` entity.
- The result is returned as an array of objects (`Object[]`), where `x[0]` is the `name` and `x[1]` is the `dob`.

### Example 3: Using Joins with Specific Fields (Employee Name, DOB, and Access Card Issued Date)

When working with relationships, such as fetching an employee's information along with details from a related entity (like `AccessCard`), you can use JPQL joins. You specify the fields from both the `Employee` and `AccessCard` entities in the query.

#### Example Code:
```java
TypedQuery<Object[]> query = entityManager.createQuery(
    "select e.name, e.dob, e.card.issuedDate from Employee e", 
    Object[].class);
List<Object[]> resultList = query.getResultList();

resultList.forEach(x -> {
    System.out.println(x[0]); // Employee name
    System.out.println(x[1]); // Employee date of birth
    System.out.println(x[2]); // Access card issued date
});
```

In this case:
- The `Employee` entity is joined with the `AccessCard` entity using the `card` relationship.
- The query fetches the `name`, `dob`, and `issuedDate` fields, where `e.card.issuedDate` refers to the `issuedDate` field of the related `AccessCard` entity.

### Summary:
1. **Fetching Specific Fields**: You can select only the necessary fields from your entities, reducing the data fetched from the database.
2. **Using Object Arrays**: When fetching multiple fields, JPQL can return the results as an array of objects (`Object[]`), and you can access each field by its index.
3. **Working with Joins**: JPQL allows you to join related entities and fetch specific fields from both entities, simplifying the query process and improving readability.

By optimizing your queries in this way, you can avoid fetching unnecessary data and improve performance when working with JPA.
