### 1. **LIKE Operator** in JPQL

The `LIKE` operator is used for pattern matching in JPQL, similar to SQL. It allows you to match strings based on a pattern.

#### Example: Fetch employees whose names start with "B"

```java
TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createQuery(
    "select e from Employee e where e.name like 'B%'", Employee.class);
List<Employee> resultList = query.getResultList();
resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

- **Pattern**: `'B%'` is the pattern we’re matching against. The `%` symbol is a wildcard, meaning that any string starting with "B" will be matched. For example, "Bob", "Billy", "Bane", etc.
- **`LIKE`**: This is case-sensitive by default, but it can vary depending on the database (e.g., some databases are case-insensitive).

If you want to match a substring or use other wildcard characters like `_` (to match a single character), you can modify the pattern accordingly:
- `'B%'` — Starts with "B".
- `'%B'` — Ends with "B".
- `'%Bob%'` — Contains "Bob" anywhere in the name.
- `'B__'` — Starts with "B" and followed by exactly two characters.

### 2. **BETWEEN Operator** in JPQL

The `BETWEEN` operator is used to check if a value falls within a specified range, including both endpoints.

#### Example: Fetch employees whose IDs are between 1 and 10

```java
TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createQuery(
    "select e from Employee e where e.id between 1 and 10", Employee.class);
List<Employee> resultList = query.getResultList();
resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

- **`BETWEEN 1 AND 10`**: This will select employees whose `id` falls between 1 and 10, inclusive. It’s like saying "ID is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10."
- **Range**: The `BETWEEN` operator works for numeric values, date ranges, and even string ranges in JPQL.

### Notes:
- The **`LIKE`** operator in JPQL works with **string properties** in entities.
- The **`BETWEEN`** operator is used for **numeric and date** ranges and can be applied to any comparable property.

These operators are useful when querying for records with specific patterns or within specific ranges, making your queries more flexible.
