In JPQL, you can easily perform joins using the relationships defined between entities without needing to explicitly define the SQL join syntax. If the relationship between entities is mapped correctly (e.g., using `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@ManyToMany`), JPQL will automatically handle the joins for you.

### Example: Fetching Employees whose Access Card is Active

Given that thereâ€™s a relationship between `Employee` and `AccessCard`, and assuming the `Employee` entity has a field called `card` that represents the relationship to `AccessCard`, you can query employees whose access card is active using JPQL:

```java
TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createQuery(
    "select e from Employee e where e.card.isActive = true", Employee.class);
List<Employee> resultList = query.getResultList();
resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

In this case:
- **`e.card`** refers to the `AccessCard` entity associated with the `Employee` (thanks to the relationship mapping in the `Employee` entity).
- **`e.card.isActive`** is accessing the `isActive` property of the `AccessCard` entity, which is assumed to be a boolean field indicating if the card is active.

---

### Equivalent SQL Query:

If you were to write this query in SQL, it would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM Employee e
JOIN AccessCard ac ON e.accessCard_id = ac.id
WHERE ac.is_active = true;
```

Here:
- **`Employee e`**: Represents the `Employee` table.
- **`AccessCard ac`**: Represents the `AccessCard` table.
- **`JOIN`**: Explicitly joins the two tables based on the relationship between the `Employee` and `AccessCard` tables.
- **`WHERE ac.is_active = true`**: Filters employees whose associated access card is active.


However if you want to use join syntax, you can do that as well.
