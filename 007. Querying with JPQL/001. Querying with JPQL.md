### 1. **Basic JPQL Query**: Fetching All Entities

In JPA, the `find()` method is great when you know the primary key of the entity, but what if you want to fetch multiple entities based on some conditions or to retrieve all records? That's where JPQL comes in.

#### Example to fetch all employees:

```java
Query query = entityManager.createQuery("select e from Employee e");
List<Employee> resultList = query.getResultList();
resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

- `select e from Employee e` is the JPQL query. The `Employee` is the entity name, not the table name. JPQL operates on entities (Java classes), not directly on the database tables.
- `e` is an alias for the `Employee` entity in the query.

You can use `createQuery()` for dynamic queries, which returns a `Query` object. To make the query type-safe, you can use `TypedQuery`.

### 2. **Using TypedQuery** (Type-Safe)

If you know the type of the result, you can use `TypedQuery` to avoid type-casting errors at runtime.

```java
TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createQuery("select e from Employee e", Employee.class);
List<Employee> resultList = query.getResultList();
resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

- `Employee.class` ensures that the query results are mapped to `Employee` entities.
- `getResultList()` will return a list of `Employee` entities.

### 3. **Using WHERE Clause** to Add Conditions

You can add conditions to the query using the `WHERE` clause. Keep in mind that JPQL uses entity properties (not table columns) in the `WHERE` clause.

#### Example to fetch employees who are older than 20:

```java
TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createQuery("select e from Employee e where e.age > 20", Employee.class);
List<Employee> resultList = query.getResultList();
resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

- `e.age` refers to the `age` attribute of the `Employee` entity, not the database column.

### 4. **Using ORDER BY Clause** to Sort Results

You can also sort the results using the `ORDER BY` clause in JPQL.

#### Example to fetch employees ordered by age in descending order:

```java
TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createQuery("select e from Employee e order by e.age desc", Employee.class);
List<Employee> resultList = query.getResultList();
resultList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

- `e.age` is the property of the `Employee` entity.
- `desc` sorts the results in descending order. You can use `asc` for ascending order (it’s the default if you don’t specify).

### Key Points:

- **JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)** works with **entities** (Java objects) and **not** directly with tables. So, the queries are written using the entity’s properties (fields) instead of the database columns.
- **`createQuery()`** returns a `Query` object for dynamic queries, and **`TypedQuery`** ensures type safety by specifying the result type.
- **WHERE clause** in JPQL allows filtering based on the entity’s attributes, and **ORDER BY** sorts the results based on entity attributes.

JPQL allows you to write queries in a way that is more object-oriented, making it easier to work with JPA entities.
