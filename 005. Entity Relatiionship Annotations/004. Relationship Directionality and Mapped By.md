# Understanding Relationship Ownership in JPA

In a relationship, the **direction of ownership** determines how JPA manages the entities and avoids circular fetches or redundant queries. This is particularly important in **bidirectional relationships**.

---

## Fetching Data and Ownership

### Example: Fetching an `AccessCard`

Previously, we saw that fetching an `Employee` also fetched its associated `AccessCard`. But what happens when we fetch an `AccessCard` and try to find the associated `Employee`?

```java
EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myApp");
EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();

AccessCard accessCard = entityManager.find(AccessCard.class, 5);
System.out.println(accessCard);
```

Output:

```plaintext
AccessCard{id=5, issuedDate=2024-12-07 12:16:17.76, isActive=true, firmwareVersion='1.0.0'}
```

Here, the `AccessCard` is fetched, but it doesn't have any reference to the associated `Employee`. This happens because the `AccessCard` entity does not yet have a property to identify the `Employee`.

---

## Establishing a Bidirectional Relationship

To fetch the `Employee` from an `AccessCard`, we need to add a reference to the `Employee` in the `AccessCard` entity.

### Updated `AccessCard` Entity:
```java
@OneToOne
private Employee employeeOwner;
```

### Updated Code to Establish Relationship:
```java
AccessCard accessCard1 = new AccessCard();
Employee employee1 = new Employee();

employee1.setAccessCard(accessCard1);
accessCard1.setEmployeeOwner(employee1);
```

This creates a **bidirectional relationship** where:
- The `Employee` references the `AccessCard`.
- The `AccessCard` references the `Employee`.

---

## The Problem: Circular Fetching

With the above setup, fetching either entity can lead to circular queries. For example, fetching an `AccessCard` will trigger a fetch for its associated `Employee`, which will in turn fetch the `AccessCard` again. This results in unnecessary queries, as shown below:

```sql
Hibernate: 
    select
        accesscard0_.id as id1_0_0_,
        accesscard0_.employeeOwner_id as employee5_0_0_,
        accesscard0_.firmwareVersion as firmware2_0_0_,
        accesscard0_.isActive as isactive3_0_0_,
        accesscard0_.issuedDate as issuedda4_0_0_,
        employee1_.id as id1_1_1_,
        employee1_.accessCard_id as accesscar5_1_1_,
        employee1_.dob as dob2_1_1_,
        employee1_.employeeType as employee3_1_1_,
        employee1_.name as name4_1_1_,
        accesscard2_.id as id1_0_2_,
        accesscard2_.employeeOwner_id as employee5_0_2_,
        accesscard2_.firmwareVersion as firmware2_0_2_,
        accesscard2_.isActive as isactive3_0_2_,
        accesscard2_.issuedDate as issuedda4_0_2_ 
    from
        AccessCard accesscard0_ 
    left outer join
        EMPLOYEE_DATA employee1_ 
            on accesscard0_.employeeOwner_id=employee1_.id 
    left outer join
        AccessCard accesscard2_ 
            on employee1_.accessCard_id=accesscard2_.id 
    where
        accesscard0_.id=?
```

## Solution: Define Ownership with `mappedBy`

To avoid circular fetching, we need to define the **owner of the relationship**. This is done using the `mappedBy` attribute. The entity owning the relationship directly manages the foreign key.

### Updated Entities:

#### `AccessCard` Entity:
```java
@Entity
public class AccessCard {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private int id;

    private Date issuedDate;
    private boolean isActive;
    private String firmwareVersion;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "accessCard")
    private Employee employeeOwner;
}
```

#### `Employee` Entity:
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "EMPLOYEE_DATA")
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private int id;

    @Column(name = "name")
    private String name;

    @Temporal(TemporalType.DATE)
    private Date dob;

    @OneToOne
    private AccessCard accessCard;
}
```

### Explanation:

- The `mappedBy` attribute in `AccessCard` tells JPA that the `Employee` entity owns the relationship.
- When fetching an `Employee`, JPA knows the `AccessCard` reference in `AccessCard` is already represented by the `accessCard` property in `Employee`.
- This avoids circular fetching.

---

## Summary

- **Bidirectional Relationships**: Both entities reference each other.
- **Ownership**: One entity must be designated as the owner of the relationship using `mappedBy`.
  - Example: `Employee` owns the `AccessCard` relationship.
- **Avoiding Circular Fetching**: Use `mappedBy` to prevent redundant queries and ensure efficient data retrieval.

By properly defining ownership, JPA can handle bidirectional relationships without unnecessary performance overheads.
