# Lets first understand how does mapped by work ?
### How are we able to get the employee of an AccessCard when, there is not foreign key in the AcessCard table.

When the `AccessCard` table does not have a foreign key to reference the `Employee` table, JPA relies on the `mappedBy` configuration to manage the relationship in memory and during database queries. Here's how JPA ensures the `AccessCard` knows about the `Employee` when data is flushed to the database and accessed again:

### **How Relationships Work Without a Foreign Key in the `AccessCard` Table**

1. **MappedBy Role in JPA:**
   The `mappedBy` attribute in the `AccessCard` entity:
   ```java
   @OneToOne(mappedBy = "accessCard")
   private Employee employeeOwner;
   ```
   informs JPA that this relationship is controlled by the `Employee` entity, specifically its `accessCard` property. This means the `AccessCard` table itself does not need a foreign key column. Instead, the `Employee` table holds the foreign key (e.g., `access_card_id`).

2. **Database Schema:**
   - **`Employee` table**: Has a column like `access_card_id`, representing the foreign key to the `AccessCard` table.
   - **`AccessCard` table**: Does not have any reference to `Employee`. 

3. **How JPA Resolves the Relationship:**
   When JPA queries the database, it uses the mapping information from the `mappedBy` attribute to fetch the relationship. For example:
   - When you load an `AccessCard`, JPA knows that the `employeeOwner` is not directly represented in the `AccessCard` table.
   - Instead, it checks the `Employee` table to find an employee where `access_card_id` matches the current `AccessCard`'s primary key.

   This process is typically handled through a **join query** behind the scenes.

### **What Happens During Flush and Reload?**

When you flush the data to the database and reload it, JPA ensures the relationship is correctly established based on the owner-side configuration (`Employee`). Here's the process:

1. **Flush to Database:**
   - When you call `employee1.setAccessCard(accessCard1)`, JPA updates the `access_card_id` column in the `Employee` table to reference the primary key of the `AccessCard`.
   - No changes are made to the `AccessCard` table itself.

2. **Reload Entities:**
   - When you fetch the `AccessCard` entity again (e.g., `entityManager.find(AccessCard.class,id)`), JPA uses the mapping configuration to retrieve the associated `Employee`:
     - It executes a query like:  
       ```sql
       SELECT e.* , a.*
       FROM Employee e 
       JOIN AccessCard a ON e.access_card_id = a.id 
       WHERE a.id = :accessCardId;
       ```
   - JPA populates the `employeeOwner` field in the `AccessCard` entity based on the query result.

---

### **Why Doesn't the `AccessCard` Table Need a Foreign Key?**

The `AccessCard` table does not need a foreign key because:
1. The relationship is **owned by the `Employee` entity**, and the `access_card_id` column in the `Employee` table fully represents this association.
2. The `AccessCard` entity's `employeeOwner` field is a **logical inverse reference**, resolved at runtime by JPA using the `mappedBy` attribute.

---

### **Illustrative Example**

#### Database State After Persistence:
- `Employee` table:
   | id  | name      | access_card_id |
   |------|-----------|----------------|
   | 1    | John Doe  | 101            |

- `AccessCard` table:
   | id  | card_number | issue_date  |
   |-----|-------------|-------------|
   | 101 | 12345       | 2024-12-01  |

#### Fetching `AccessCard` and Resolving Employee:
When you fetch an `AccessCard`:
```java
AccessCard accessCard = accessCardRepository.findById(101);
Employee employee = accessCard.getEmployeeOwner();
```
1. JPA performs a **join query** to find the associated `Employee`:
   ```sql
   SELECT e.*
   FROM Employee e
   JOIN AccessCard a ON e.access_card_id = a.id
   WHERE a.id = 101;
   ```
2. The result is used to populate the `employeeOwner` field in the `AccessCard` entity.
