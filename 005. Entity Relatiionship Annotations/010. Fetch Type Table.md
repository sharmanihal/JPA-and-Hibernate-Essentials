Table summarizing the **fetch types** (`FetchType.LAZY` and `FetchType.EAGER`) for all types of relationships in JPA:

| **Relationship Type**       | **Default Fetch Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                             | **Use Cases for Fetch Type**                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`@OneToOne`**              | `EAGER`               | A single entity is associated with another single entity.                                                                                                                   | - Use `LAZY` if the related entity is not always needed to optimize performance. <br>- Use `EAGER` if the relationship is critical and always used. |
| **`@ManyToOne`**             | `EAGER`               | Multiple entities are associated with a single entity (e.g., Many employees -> One department).                                                                              | - Default `EAGER` works well when the relationship is frequently accessed.<br>- Use `LAZY` if loading the related entity is not always required.    |
| **`@OneToMany`**             | `LAZY`                | A single entity is associated with multiple entities (e.g., One department -> Many employees).                                                                              | - Default `LAZY` is optimal for large collections.<br>- Use `EAGER` if the child entities are always accessed with the parent.                     |
| **`@ManyToMany`**            | `LAZY`                | Many entities are associated with many other entities (e.g., Many employees -> Many email groups).                                                                          | - Default `LAZY` is preferred for large datasets.<br>- Use `EAGER` only when it is certain that the data is always accessed together.              |
