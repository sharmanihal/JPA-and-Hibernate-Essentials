### Now that we understand the mappedBy feature of JPA, you might be questioning, well if mappedBy will let JPA take care of fetching the Employee of a AccessCard why we do:
```
AccessCard accessCard= entityManager.find(AccessCard.class,1);
accessCard.getEmployee();
```

Why do we need to do this while persisting the AccessCard and Employee Entity ?

```
AcessCard acessCard1 = new AcessCard();
Employee employee1 = new Employee();
employee1.setAccessCard(acessCard1);
acessCard1.setEmployee(employee1);
```

Why are we explicity setting the employee for the acess card, when JPA while finding the access card knows how to populate the Employee using the mappedBy feature.

### Let's understand why ?

### **Understanding the Problem**
In JPA, when you set up a bidirectional relationship between two entities, like `Employee` and `AccessCard`, the goal is to ensure that changes in one entity reflect consistently in the other during the application's runtime. Here, the `Employee` entity is the **owner of the relationship**, as specified by the `mappedBy` attribute on the `AccessCard` entity.

#### **MappedBy Attribute**
The `mappedBy` attribute in the `AccessCard` entity:
```java
@OneToOne(mappedBy = "accessCard")
private Employee employeeOwner;
```
instructs JPA that the relationship is controlled by the `accessCard` property in the `Employee` entity. This means JPA will look at the `Employee`'s `accessCard` field to determine the relationship. Essentially:
- **Owner side (`Employee`)**: Controls the relationship and manages the foreign key in the database.
- **Inverse side (`AccessCard`)**: Provides a view of the relationship but does not directly manage it.

---

### **Why Do We Need to Set Both Sides?**

1. **Setting the Relationship on the Owner Side:**
   When you call `employee1.setAccessCard(accessCard1)`, you are establishing the relationship on the **owner side**, making `Employee` recognize the `AccessCard`. This is **necessary** because only the owner side (`Employee`) determines how the relationship is persisted to the database. Without this, the database will not associate the two entities.

2. **Setting the Relationship on the Inverse Side:**
   When you call `accessCard1.setEmployee(employee1)`, you are establishing the relationship on the **inverse side**, making the `AccessCard` entity aware of its `Employee`. Although this step does not affect database persistence directly (since the inverse side does not control the relationship), it ensures that the relationship is **consistent in memory**.

---

### **What Happens if You Don’t Set the Inverse Side?**
If you do not explicitly set the relationship on the inverse side (`accessCard1.setEmployee(employee1)`), the following may happen:
1. **Before Flush/Commit:**
   JPA does not immediately write changes to the database. It may delay the flush to optimize performance. If, during this period, you try to access the `employeeOwner` property of the `AccessCard` entity, you will get `null`. This is because the inverse side (`employeeOwner`) has not been explicitly initialized, and JPA does not infer it from the owner side (`Employee.accessCard`) at this point.

2. **After Flush/Commit:**
   Once the persistence context is synchronized with the database (i.e., after flush or transaction commit), JPA will correctly populate both sides of the relationship. If you then access the `employeeOwner` from the `AccessCard`, it will work as expected. However, relying on this behavior introduces **inconsistent states** during the runtime, which can lead to bugs and hard-to-debug issues.

---

### **Consistency in Memory**
Explicitly setting the relationship on both sides ensures that the state of the objects in memory remains **consistent**:
```java
AccessCard accessCard1 = new AccessCard();
Employee employee1 = new Employee();

// Set the relationship on both sides
employee1.setAccessCard(accessCard1);
accessCard1.setEmployee(employee1);
```
Here’s what happens:
- `Employee` knows which `AccessCard` it owns.
- `AccessCard` knows which `Employee` owns it.
- During runtime, even before a flush or commit, both sides reflect the relationship accurately.

This is especially important in a **long-running transaction** where objects might be manipulated in memory before being flushed to the database.

---

### **Super Detailed Example**

Consider the following scenario:
1. **Setup Entities:**
   ```java
   AccessCard accessCard1 = new AccessCard();
   Employee employee1 = new Employee();
   ```
2. **Set Relationship Only on Owner Side:**
   ```java
   employee1.setAccessCard(accessCard1);
   ```
   If you now try to access `accessCard1.getEmployeeOwner()`, it will return `null` because the inverse side has not been explicitly set.

3. **Set Relationship on Both Sides:**
   ```java
   accessCard1.setEmployee(employee1);
   ```
   Now, both `employee1.getAccessCard()` and `accessCard1.getEmployeeOwner()` return the correct references, ensuring consistency in memory.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Bidirectional Consistency:** Always set the relationship on both sides (owner and inverse) to ensure consistent in-memory state.
2. **Database Persistence:** Only the owner side determines the database relationship. The inverse side is ignored for persistence.
3. **Avoid Null References:** Explicitly setting both sides prevents null references when accessing the relationship in-memory before flush or commit.

---

By explicitly setting both sides of the relationship, you reduce the chances of inconsistent data, null pointers, and unexpected behavior during the application's runtime.
