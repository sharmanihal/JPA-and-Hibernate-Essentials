# Mapping Employee to AccessCard in JPA
Let's explore how to map a relationship between two entities: `Employee` and `AccessCard`. We'll start by looking at the database (DB) perspective and then move to how we can implement the relationship using JPA (Java Persistence API).

## DB Perspective: How to Associate Employee with AccessCard

To establish a relationship between `Employee` and `AccessCard` in the database, we need to add a foreign key reference. There are multiple ways to achieve this, but let's look at the simple approach where we add the `accessCardId` to the `Employee` table.

### 1. No Foreign Key - Just Matching Values

In a scenario where there is no foreign key, we can store the `AccessCard` ID in the `Employee` entity, as shown below:

```java
private int accessCardId;

public int getAccessCardId() {
    return accessCardId;
}

public void setAccessCardId(int accessCardId) {
    this.accessCardId = accessCardId;
}
```

In the code where we create an `Employee` instance and associate it with an `AccessCard`:

```java
AccessCard accessCard1 = new AccessCard();
accessCard1.setActive(true);
accessCard1.setFirmwareVersion("1.0.0");
accessCard1.setIssuedDate(new Date());
accessCard1.setId(10);

Employee employee1 = new Employee();
employee1.setName("Bob");
employee1.setDob(new Date());
employee1.setEmployeeType(EmployeeType.LEAVE);
employee1.setAccessCardId(accessCard1.getId());
```

At this point, the database will store the `accessCardId` in the `Employee` table. However, this does **not** create a true relationship between `Employee` and `AccessCard`. If the `AccessCard` is deleted, the reference in the `Employee` table will still exist, leading to potential inconsistency.

### 2. Missing Relationship: Java Perspective

From a Java perspective, the `Employee` and `AccessCard` are separate instances. By only assigning the `accessCardId`, we're not establishing a true relationship between them. This can cause issues when we try to perform operations like cascading deletes or fetching related data. 

What if the `accessCardId` is auto-generated in the database? How will we assign it to the `Employee`? We need a stronger link between these two entities.

## JPA Perspective: Establishing the Relationship

Let's now move to JPA and see how we can establish a true relationship between `Employee` and `AccessCard`.

### 1. Using JPA Relationships

In Java, instead of using a primitive `int` to represent the `AccessCard`, we can use the `AccessCard` entity directly. This way, we're linking the two entities properly and telling JPA to handle the relationship.

First, we remove the `accessCardId` property from the `Employee` entity and introduce a reference to the `AccessCard` entity:

```java
// The actual card allocated for this employee
private AccessCard accessCard;

public AccessCard getAccessCard() {
    return accessCard;
}

public void setAccessCard(AccessCard accessCard) {
    this.accessCard = accessCard;
}
```

Now, when creating an `Employee` and linking it with an `AccessCard`, we do it like this:

```java
AccessCard accessCard1 = new AccessCard();
accessCard1.setActive(true);
accessCard1.setFirmwareVersion("1.0.0");
accessCard1.setIssuedDate(new Date());

Employee employee1 = new Employee();
employee1.setName("Bob");
employee1.setDob(new Date());
employee1.setEmployeeType(EmployeeType.LEAVE);
employee1.setAccessCard(accessCard1);
```

This establishes a true relationship where the `Employee` has an `AccessCard`. However, JPA still doesn't know how to map this relationship to the database.

---

### 2. Foreign Key and Relationship Mapping in JPA

We need to tell JPA that the `AccessCard` in the `Employee` entity represents a relationship and that `AccessCard` is a separate entity in its own right. This can be done using JPA annotations.

Since this is a one-to-one relationship (one employee can have one access card, and one access card is assigned to one employee), we use the `@OneToOne` annotation in the `Employee` entity:

```java
@OneToOne
private AccessCard accessCard;
```

This annotation tells JPA that the `AccessCard` is a separate entity and the relationship between `Employee` and `AccessCard` should be represented in the database with a foreign key.

---

### 3. JPA DDL Output

When JPA processes this mapping, it will generate the necessary database schema. The resulting `Employee` table will have a foreign key reference to the `AccessCard` table. Here is an example of the generated DDL (Data Definition Language):

```sql
Hibernate: 
    create table AccessCard (
       id integer not null,
        firmwareVersion varchar(255),
        isActive boolean not null,
        issuedDate timestamp,
        primary key (id)
    )

Hibernate: 
    create table EMPLOYEE_DATA (
       id integer not null,
        dob date,
        employeeType varchar(255),
        name varchar(255),
        accessCard_id integer,
        primary key (id)
    )

Hibernate: 
    alter table EMPLOYEE_DATA 
       add constraint FK7wgy5gh29n8s1ye66koxyfjja 
       foreign key (accessCard_id) 
       references AccessCard
```

Here, the `AccessCard` table is created, and the `EMPLOYEE_DATA` table is created with a foreign key constraint linking `accessCard_id` to `AccessCard`'s `id`.

---

## Conclusion

By using JPA annotations like `@OneToOne`, we've established a true relationship between `Employee` and `AccessCard`. JPA handles the foreign key mapping for us and ensures that both entities are linked properly. This relationship can now be used for various operations like cascading deletes, fetch operations, and maintaining data integrity between the two entities.
