### Understanding Many-to-Many Relationships with an Example of Email Groups

#### Scenario
- **Problem Statement**: An employee can be part of multiple email groups, and an email group can have multiple employees. 
- **Entity without Relationships**: 

```java
@Entity
public class EmailGroup {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private int groupId;

    private String groupName;
}
```

### Database Perspective
- **Comparison with One-to-Many Relationship**:
  - For a one-to-many relationship (e.g., Employee and Payslip):
    - The **Payslip table** keeps a foreign key referencing the **Employee table**.
  - One payslip belongs to one employee, so a single foreign key is sufficient.

- **For Many-to-Many Relationship**:
  - **Employee table** can't have a foreign key for groups (one employee can have multiple groups).
  - **EmailGroup table** can't have a foreign key for employees (one group can have multiple employees).
  - **Solution**: Create a separate mapping table to store the combination of both.

#### Mapping Table
The mapping table represents the many-to-many relationship:
```
Employee_Group_Mapping
+--------+----------+
| EMP_ID | GROUP_ID |
+--------+----------+
|   1    |    1     |
|   1    |    2     |
|   2    |    2     |
+--------+----------+
```
This shows:
- Employee 1 is part of groups 1 and 2.
- Employee 2 is part of group 2.

### Java Perspective
In Java, the many-to-many relationship is similar to a one-to-many relationship but bidirectional. 

#### Employee Entity
```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @ManyToMany
    private List<EmailGroup> emailGroups;
}
```

#### EmailGroup Entity
```java
@Entity
public class EmailGroup {
    @ManyToMany
    private List<Employee> employeeList;
}
```

### The Role of `mappedBy`
#### Why is `mappedBy` Required?
If you define the relationship without `mappedBy`, JPA creates **two separate mapping tables**:
1. One for the relationship from `Employee` to `EmailGroup`.
2. Another for the relationship from `EmailGroup` to `Employee`.

Example Code:
```java
EmailGroup emailGroup1 = new EmailGroup();
emailGroup1.setGroupName("Legacy Team");

EmailGroup emailGroup2 = new EmailGroup();
emailGroup2.setGroupName("Testing Team");

employee1.setEmailGroups(List.of(emailGroup1, emailGroup2));
emailGroup1.setEmployeeList(List.of(employee1));
emailGroup2.setEmployeeList(List.of(employee1));
```
- Without `mappedBy`, JPA doesn't understand these two are the same relationship, resulting in duplicate mapping tables.

#### How to Use `mappedBy`
- **Purpose**: To link the two relationships as one and avoid duplicate tables.
- **Placement**: It can be placed in either entity, as long as it points to the field in the other entity that owns the relationship.

Example:
```java
@ManyToMany(mappedBy = "emailGroups")
private List<Employee> employeeList;
```
Now, only **one mapping table** is created to track the relationship.

### Summary
- **Many-to-Many DB Design**:
  - Use a separate mapping table (e.g., `Employee_Group_Mapping`).
- **Java Implementation**:
  - Define `@ManyToMany` relationships in both entities.
  - Use `mappedBy` in one entity to avoid duplicate mapping tables.
- **Key Concept**: `mappedBy` ensures both sides of the relationship are treated as one by JPA.
