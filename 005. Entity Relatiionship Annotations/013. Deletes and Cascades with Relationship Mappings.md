### **Deleting Relationships in JPA**

When deleting an entity in JPA, the behavior depends on the type of relationship and any cascading or orphan removal annotations. Hereâ€™s a structured guide to understanding this:

---

### **Default Behavior Without Annotations**

1. **`@ManyToMany` Relationships**:
   - If an entity (e.g., `Employee`) is deleted:
     - The associated rows in the join table (e.g., `EMAIL_GROUP_SUBSCRIPTIONS`) are deleted automatically.
     - **No constraint violations occur** because the join table doesn't hold foreign key constraints to child tables.

2. **`@OneToMany` or `@ManyToOne` Relationships**:
   - If an entity (e.g., `Employee`) is deleted:
     - **Constraint violations** occur because child rows (e.g., `Payslip`) have foreign key constraints pointing to the parent (`Employee`).
     - By default, JPA does **not** cascade deletions to child entities.

3. **`@OneToOne` Relationships**:
   - Deleting one side of the relationship behaves as follows:
     - If the owning side is deleted, the related row (on the inverse side) remains, and its foreign key is set to `NULL`.
     - If the non-owning side is deleted, a **constraint violation** may occur if the database schema doesn't allow the foreign key to be `NULL`.

### **Customizing Deletion Behavior**

#### 1. **Cascade Deletion**
- Use **`cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE`** to ensure related entities are deleted when the parent is deleted.
- Example:
    ```java
    @Entity
    public class Payslip {
        @ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE) // Cascade removal of Payslip when Employee is deleted
        @JoinColumn(name = "payslip_for_emp")
        private Employee employee;
    }
    ```

    **Effect**:
    - When an `Employee` is deleted, all related `Payslip` entries are also deleted.

---

#### 2. **Orphan Removal**
- Use **`orphanRemoval = true`** to delete child entities that are no longer associated with the parent.
- Example:
    ```java
    @Entity
    public class Employee {
        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "employee", orphanRemoval = true)
        private List<Payslip> payslips;
    }
    ```
    **Effect**:
    - If a `Payslip` is removed from the `Employee.payslips` list, it will be automatically deleted from the database.

---

#### 3. **No Cascade or Orphan Removal (Tracking Case)**
- For entities you want to retain (e.g., `Payslip`, `AccessCard`), simply do **not** configure cascade or orphan removal:
    ```java
    @Entity
    public class Payslip {
        @ManyToOne
        @JoinColumn(name = "payslip_for_emp")
        private Employee employee;
    }
    ```

    **Effect**:
    - Deleting an `Employee` will throw a constraint violation because `Payslip` still references it. 
    - This is useful for historical data (e.g., keeping payroll records after an employee leaves).

---

#### Deleting an Employee:
```java
EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myApp");
EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();

Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1);

EntityTransaction transaction = entityManager.getTransaction();
transaction.begin();
entityManager.remove(employee); // Automatically deletes Payslips and updates Join Table
transaction.commit();
```

### **Behavior Summary Table**

| **Relationship**            | **Default Behavior**                                | **With `CascadeType.REMOVE`**                  | **With `orphanRemoval = true`**                     |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **`@ManyToMany`**            | Deletes rows in join table automatically.         | No effect (join table rows are auto-managed). | Not applicable.                                   |
| **`@OneToMany`**             | Throws constraint violation if child exists.      | Deletes all child entities.                   | Deletes child entities if removed from collection. |
| **`@ManyToOne`**             | Throws constraint violation if referenced parent is deleted. | Deletes parent and sets child references to `NULL`. | Not applicable.                                   |
| **`@OneToOne`**              | Parent deletion sets FK to `NULL` by default.     | Deletes related entity.                       | Deletes related entity if association is removed. |

---

### **Summary**
- Use **`CascadeType.REMOVE`** when child entities should be deleted with the parent.
- Use **`orphanRemoval = true`** when child entities should be deleted when no longer associated with the parent.
- For entities that should persist after parent deletion (e.g., `Payslip` for record-keeping), do **not** configure cascade or orphan removal.
