# Implications of Relationships When Fetching Data in JPA

When dealing with relationships in JPA, fetching data becomes a critical aspect. Unlike standalone entities, fetching related entities introduces nuances. Understanding these is key to ensuring efficient data retrieval and avoiding unnecessary database operations.

## Fetching Data with Relationships

### Example: Fetching an `Employee` with a One-to-One Relationship

Consider an `Employee` entity with a one-to-one relationship with `AccessCard`. When we fetch an `Employee` from the database:

```java
EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myApp");
EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();

Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 3);
System.out.println(employee);
```

Output:

```plaintext
Employee{id=3, name='Bob', dob=2024-12-07, employeeType=LEAVE}
```

The `AccessCard` data is not printed because it was not included in the `toString()` method of the `Employee` entity. If we include it, the output will display the `AccessCard` details:

```plaintext
Employee{id=3, name='Bob', dob=2024-12-07, employeeType=LEAVE, accessCard=AccessCard{id=5, issuedDate=2024-12-07 12:16:17.76, isActive=true, firmwareVersion='1.0.0'}}
```

**Observation:**  
JPA automatically fetches both the `Employee` and its associated `AccessCard`. The SQL query executed by JPA demonstrates this:

```sql
Hibernate: 
    select
        employee0_.id as id1_1_0_,
        employee0_.acessCard_id as acesscar5_1_0_,
        employee0_.dob as dob2_1_0_,
        employee0_.employeeType as employee3_1_0_,
        employee0_.name as name4_1_0_,
        acesscard1_.id as id1_0_1_,
        acesscard1_.firmwareVersion as firmware2_0_1_,
        acesscard1_.isActive as isactive3_0_1_,
        acesscard1_.issuedDate as issuedda4_0_1_ 
    from
        EMPLOYEE_DATA employee0_ 
    left outer join
        AcessCard acesscard1_ 
            on employee0_.acessCard_id=acesscard1_.id 
    where
        employee0_.id=?
```

### Fetching Data Eagerly vs. Lazily

By default, JPA fetches relationships *eagerly*, which means it retrieves related entities automatically when the parent entity is fetched. This behavior is convenient in some cases but can lead to performance issues if the parent entity has relationships with multiple other entities.

#### Scenario: Avoid Eager Fetching

If you only need the parent entity (e.g., `Employee`) and donâ€™t want the related entity (e.g., `AccessCard`) data to be fetched automatically, you can use *lazy fetching*. This ensures related data is fetched only when explicitly accessed.

```java
@OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private AccessCard accessCard;
```

With lazy fetching, the `AccessCard` data will only be retrieved when you call `employee.getAccessCard()`. This reduces the number of queries and optimizes performance.

### Importance of Lazy Fetching in One-to-Many Relationships

Lazy fetching is particularly important in relationships like **One-to-Many**, where one entity (e.g., `Department`) is related to multiple child entities (e.g., `Employees`). If the `Department` has hundreds of employees, eager fetching would load all employees even if only the department information is needed.

---

## Summary

- **Default Fetching**: JPA fetches relationships eagerly unless specified otherwise.
- **Eager Fetching**: Related entities are automatically retrieved with the parent entity.
  - Example: Fetching an `Employee` automatically retrieves its `AccessCard`.
- **Lazy Fetching**: Related entities are retrieved only when explicitly accessed.
  - Example: Use `FetchType.LAZY` to avoid unnecessary data retrieval.
- **One-to-Many**: Lazy fetching is critical to prevent loading large collections unnecessarily.

By understanding and configuring fetch types appropriately, you can optimize performance and control how relationships are handled during data retrieval.
