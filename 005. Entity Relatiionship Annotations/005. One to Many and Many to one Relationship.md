# Understanding One-to-Many and Many-to-One Relationships in JPA

In JPA, a **One-to-Many** relationship and a **Many-to-One** relationship are essentially the same thing, but their direction determines which entity owns the relationship. These relationships are commonly used when one entity is associated with multiple instances of another entity. Let's dive into the concept with an example of an **Employee** and their **Payslips**.

---

## Example: Employee and Payslip Relationship

### The Concept

An **Employee** can have multiple **Payslips**, and each **Payslip** belongs to one **Employee**. This represents a **One-to-Many** relationship from the **Employee** side and a **Many-to-One** relationship from the **Payslip** side.

### `Payslip` Entity

Letâ€™s start by defining the `Payslip` entity:

```java
@Entity
public class Payslip {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private int id;

    private Date payPeriodStart;

    private Date payPeriodEnd;

    private float salary;

    @ManyToOne
    private Employee employee;
}
```

In this case:
- The `Payslip` entity has a reference to the `Employee` entity.
- **Many `Payslip` entities belong to one `Employee` entity**. Hence, we use the `@ManyToOne` annotation on the `employee` field.


## How Foreign Key is Managed in the Database

### One-to-Many Relationship in the Database

In a **One-to-Many** relationship, the **"many" side** of the relationship holds the **foreign key**. This means that in the **Payslip** table, there will be an `employee_id` column that references the `Employee` table. This is because multiple `Payslips` can be associated with one `Employee`, but we don't want to repeat the `Employee` data in the `Payslip` table.

### Why Not a Foreign Key in the Employee Table?

Unlike the **Employee and AccessCard** relationship, where we had a foreign key in the **Employee** table, in a **One-to-Many** relationship, we can't store multiple foreign keys in the **Employee** table because that would break normalization. 

Instead, the **Payslip** table holds the foreign key (`employee_id`), ensuring the database remains normalized.

## Working with the Relationship in Code

### Setting up the Relationship

To associate a `Payslip` with an `Employee`, you set the `Employee` reference in the `Payslip` entity.

```java
Payslip payslip1 = new Payslip();
payslip1.setSalary(70000);
payslip1.setPayPeriodStart(new Date());
payslip1.setPayPeriodEnd(new Date());
payslip1.setEmployee(employee1);
```

This way, you can assign an `Employee` to a `Payslip` object. Since the `Payslip` entity already knows the `Employee` via the `employee` field, JPA will automatically insert the foreign key in the `Payslip` table.

### Fetching Payslip and it's associated Employee

```java
EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myApp");
EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();

Payslip payslip = entityManager.find(Payslip.class, 5);
System.out.println(payslip.getEmployee());
```

This fetches the `playslip` and its associated `Employee`.

## Summary

- **One-to-Many** and **Many-to-One** relationships represent the same concept, but the direction of the relationship differs.
  - **One-to-Many**: One entity is associated with multiple entities (e.g., one `Employee` can have many `Payslips`).
  - **Many-to-One**: Many entities are associated with a single entity (e.g., each `Payslip` belongs to one `Employee`).
- In a **One-to-Many** relationship, the **"many" side** (e.g., `Payslip`) holds the **foreign key** to maintain database normalization.
- The `@ManyToOne` annotation is used on the **"many" side**, and the `@OneToMany` annotation is used on the **"one" side**.

This is the foundation of how **One-to-Many** and **Many-to-One** relationships work in JPA, especially in the context of associating entities like `Employee` and `Payslip`.

---

In JPA, to retrieve the **Payslips** associated with an **Employee**, you can follow a similar approach as we discussed earlier for accessing relationships, but with a focus on the **One-to-Many** side.

Let's walk through this with an example based on your given scenario.

---

## Fetching Payslips for an Employee

### Step 1: Mapping the Payslips to the Employee

As you mentioned, we can map the **Payslips** to the **Employee** using the `@OneToMany` relationship in the `Employee` entity. The `mappedBy` attribute tells JPA that the relationship is maintained by the `employee` field in the **Payslip** entity.

### Employee Entity

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private int id;

    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "employee")
    private List<Payslip> payslips;
}
```

In the above code:
- The `mappedBy = "employee"` refers to the `employee` field in the **Payslip** entity, indicating that the **Employee** is the "one" side of the relationship, and **Payslip** is the "many" side.

### Step 2: Creating Payslips and Associating them with the Employee

When you create **Payslip** instances and associate them with an **Employee**, you do it as follows:

```java
Payslip payslip1 = new Payslip();
Payslip payslip2 = new Payslip();
payslip1.setSalary(70000);
payslip2.setSalary(75000);
payslip1.setPayPeriodStart(new Date());
payslip2.setPayPeriodStart(new Date());
payslip1.setPayPeriodEnd(new Date());
payslip2.setPayPeriodEnd(new Date());
payslip1.setEmployee(employee1);
payslip2.setEmployee(employee1);

List<Payslip> employee1PaySlips = List.of(payslip1, payslip2);
employee1.setPayslips(employee1PaySlips);
```

### Step 3: Fetching the Payslips of an Employee

To retrieve the **Payslips** associated with an **Employee**, you simply fetch the **Employee** entity and access its `payslips` property, as shown below:

```java
EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myApp");
EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();

Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1);
employee.getPayslips().forEach(System.out::println);
```

### What Happens Internally?

- When you call `entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1)`, JPA retrieves the **Employee** entity with `id = 1` from the database.
- The `@OneToMany(mappedBy = "employee")` annotation ensures that the list of **Payslips** associated with this employee is fetched.
- The **Payslips** are fetched based on the foreign key `employee_id` in the **Payslip** table (the "many" side), which links back to the **Employee** entity.
  
### Output

After fetching the employee's payslips, the payslips will be printed. The output might look like:

```
Payslip{id=1, payPeriodStart=2024-12-01, payPeriodEnd=2024-12-31, salary=70000}
Payslip{id=2, payPeriodStart=2024-11-01, payPeriodEnd=2024-11-30, salary=75000}
```

Each payslip will have details such as its **pay period**, **salary**, and so on.

---

## Summary

- The **Employee** entity holds a list of **Payslips**, and you use the `@OneToMany` annotation to represent the relationship from the **Employee** side.
- The `mappedBy` attribute tells JPA which field owns the relationship on the **Payslip** side (in this case, it's the `employee` field).
- When you fetch an **Employee** entity, you can access its associated **Payslips** by calling the `getPayslips()` method.
- The **Payslips** are fetched based on the foreign key in the **Payslip** table, which points to the **Employee** entity.

This approach helps maintain the integrity of the relationship and ensures that JPA handles the relationship mapping efficiently.
