# Deep Dive into `@Id` Annotation in JPA

The `@Id` annotation marks a property as the **primary key** of a table. It ensures that the property is **unique** and **not null**. Below are some key points to consider:

## Supported Types for `@Id`
- **Primitive types** (e.g., `int`, `long`) can be used as primary keys.
- **Wrapper classes** (e.g., `Integer`, `Long`) are also valid for primary keys.
- **Strings** can be primary keys, but they may lead to performance implications.

### Note:
Using `long` as an ID is **not recommended** because it is not a **persistent type** and can have issues with **decimal points**.

## Automating ID Generation with `@GeneratedValue`

If you don't want to manually set the primary key, you can delegate the responsibility to the database using `@GeneratedValue`. Example:

```java
@Id
@Column(name = "id")
@GeneratedValue
private int id;
```

When this is configured, JPA in conjunction with the database will handle primary key generation. The ID will still be associated with the entity in the database.

### Strategies for `@GeneratedValue`

The `@GeneratedValue` annotation allows specifying strategies for ID generation. Here are the available strategies:

1. **AUTO**: 
   - The database decides the strategy to use based on the DB driver's specification.

2. **SEQUENCE**: 
   - The database maintains a **sequence object**.
   - For every new insert, it uses the sequence value and increments it for the next usage.
   - Example: A table named `hibernate_sequence` is generated to keep track of IDs.

3. **TABLE**:
   - A separate table is created in the database to keep track of the ID values.
   - This table is updated for every new ID generated.

4. **IDENTITY**:
   - Relies on the database's built-in **auto-increment** feature.
   - The database automatically generates a new ID for each insert operation.
   - Commonly used with databases like MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL that support auto-increment columns.
   - No additional tracking tables or sequences are required, as the ID is generated directly in the table itself.

## Best Practices
- In most cases, **AUTO** is preferred as JPA can determine the appropriate strategy based on the database.
