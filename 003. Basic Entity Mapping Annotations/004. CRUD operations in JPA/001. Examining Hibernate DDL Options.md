Before diving into CRUD operations, we need to make changes to our `persistence.xml` file.

---

## Current Configuration in `persistence.xml`

The property currently set in `persistence.xml` is:

```xml
<property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" value="create-drop"/>
```

### What `create-drop` Does:
- **At application startup**: Drops the entity-related table if it exists, then creates it again.
- **At persistence context closure**: Drops the table.

This behavior is not desirable for applications where we want to maintain data across application restarts.

## Alternative Values for `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto`

Here are the possible values for the `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto` property and their behavior:

1. **validate**:
   - Verifies if the entity definitions in Java match the table definitions in the database.
   - Does **not** create, drop, or modify tables.
   - Assumes the database schema already exists.
   - Useful for enterprise applications where the database schema is pre-defined.

2. **update**:
   - Does **not** drop the table.
   - Updates the table schema when necessary.
     - Example: If the entity column length is updated from 50 to 100, this change will reflect in the database table.
   - Does **not** delete existing data.

3. **create**:
   - Similar to `create-drop`, but:
     - Drops the table at the start of the application.
     - Creates the table again.
     - **Does not drop the table** when the persistence context is closed.

4. **none**:
   - Performs no actions.
   - Does not create, drop, or validate tables.

## Closing the Persistence Context

To properly manage resources, always close the persistence context when you're done:

```java
entityManager.close();
entityManagerFactory.close();
```

This ensures efficient resource management and avoids potential memory leaks.

## Recommended Setting for CRUD Operations

To understand CRUD operations and avoid losing data, set the property to **update**:

```xml
<property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" value="update"/>
```

With this configuration:
- The database schema will be updated as needed.
- Existing data will remain intact.
