### Modes of Operation:

1. **In-Memory Database**:
   - The database resides in the memory of the Java application.
   - Consumes the same processing capacity as the application.
   - Data is lost when the application shuts down.

2. **Server Mode**:
   - Runs as a separate database server.
   - Applications connect to it like a regular database server.
   - Data persists beyond the application's lifecycle.

2. Download the installer for your operating system.
3. Install the application to spin up the database in server mode.
