# Reading Employee Instances from the Database with JPA

In this guide, we'll learn how to read persisted employee instances from the database using JPA. The process involves utilizing the `EntityManager` to fetch data from the database.

---

## Steps for Reading Data

### 1. Create an `EntityManagerFactory`
The `EntityManagerFactory` is created based on the configuration in `persistence.xml`. 

```java
EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myApp");
```

### 2. Create an `EntityManager`
The `EntityManager` is created using the factory. It is responsible for managing entities and is required for performing any entity operations.

```java
EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
```

## Using the `find()` Method

To read an entity from the database, we use the `find()` method provided by `EntityManager`. 

### Syntax
```java
entityManager.find(EntityClass, id);
```

- **EntityClass**: The class of the entity you want to fetch.
- **id**: The primary key of the entity to be retrieved.

This method is analogous to SQL queries like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE id = 1;
```

### Example: Reading an Employee
```java
Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1);
```

- The above code fetches the `Employee` instance with ID `1` from the database.
- The `find()` method returns an entity instance that is retrieved from the database.

## Key Notes

- **EntityManager**: Always use it to perform entity operations. It manages the lifecycle of entity instances.
- **No Transactions Required**: For read operations, transactions are not necessary.

**Note :** What if we give id , that does not exist ? The employee instance will be null.
