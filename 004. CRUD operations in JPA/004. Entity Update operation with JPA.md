# Deleting Data in the Database with JPA

In this guide, weâ€™ll learn how to delete records from the database using JPA. The process involves finding the entity to delete and instructing the `EntityManager` to remove it.

## SQL Analogy for Delete

In SQL, deleting a record involves selecting the rows you want to delete and performing a `DELETE` operation. For example:

```sql
DELETE FROM employee_data WHERE id = 1;
```

Similarly, in JPA:
1. Use the `find()` method to retrieve the entity you want to delete.
2. Use the `remove()` method of the `EntityManager` to delete the entity.

## Steps for Deleting an Entity in JPA

### 1. Fetch the Entity to Delete
Retrieve the entity using the `find()` method.

```java
EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myApp");
EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();

Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1);
```

### 2. Start a Transaction
Since deleting a record involves modifying the database, a transaction is required.

```java
EntityTransaction transaction = entityManager.getTransaction();
transaction.begin();
```

### 3. Delete the Entity
Use the `remove()` method of the `EntityManager` to delete the fetched entity.

```java
entityManager.remove(employee);
```

### 4. Commit the Transaction and Close Resources
Commit the transaction and close the `EntityManager` and `EntityManagerFactory`.

```java
transaction.commit();
entityManager.close();
entityManagerFactory.close();
```

## Complete Example: Deleting an Employee

Below is a complete example of deleting an employee with ID `1`:

```java
EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myApp");
EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();

Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1);

EntityTransaction transaction = entityManager.getTransaction();
transaction.begin();

entityManager.remove(employee);

transaction.commit();
entityManager.close();
entityManagerFactory.close();
```

## Key Points

- **`find()` Method**: Used to retrieve the entity you want to delete.
- **`remove()` Method**: Deletes the entity from the database.
- **Transaction Required**: Deleting data involves modifying the database, so a transaction must be started and committed.
- **Primary Key**: JPA uses the primary key to identify the entity in the database.
