### Understanding Relationships Between Entities

To understand how relationships work between entities, we need at least two entities. In this note, we will create a new entity to demonstrate the relationship. Let's create an **Access Card** entity, where each employee has exactly one access card.

#### AccessCard Entity

Here is the definition of the `AccessCard` entity:

```java
@Entity
public class AccessCard {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private int id;

    private Date issuedDate;
    private boolean isActive;
    private String firmwareVersion;
}
```

#### Key Points:
- **Entity**: `AccessCard` represents the access card of an employee.
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the access card.
  - `issuedDate`: The date when the card was issued.
  - `isActive`: Indicates whether the access card is active or not.
  - `firmwareVersion`: The firmware version of the access card.
  
#### Next Steps:
To establish a relationship between `AccessCard` and another entity (e.g., `Employee`), we will need to define the mapping in the next steps.
