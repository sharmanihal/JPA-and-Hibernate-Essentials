# Updating Data in the Database with JPA

In this guide, weâ€™ll explore how to update data in the database using JPA. The process involves fetching an entity, modifying it, and saving the changes back to the database.

## SQL Analogy for Update

In SQL, updating a record involves fetching the rows you want to modify and applying the changes. For example:

```sql
UPDATE employee_data SET age = 20 WHERE id = 1;
```

Similarly, in Java, you:
1. Fetch the entity you want to update using the `find()` method.
2. Modify the entity by calling setters.
3. Persist the changes and commit the transaction.

## Steps for Updating an Entity in JPA

### 1. Fetch the Entity to Update
Use the `find()` method to retrieve the entity you want to modify.

```java
EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myApp");
EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1);
```

### 2. Modify the Entity
Call the appropriate setter methods to make changes to the fetched entity.

```java
employee.setEmployeeType(EmployeeType.FULLTIME);
```

At this point, the entity is modified in memory but not yet saved to the database.

### 3. Persist the Changes
To save the updated entity to the database:
1. Start a transaction.
2. Use the `persist()` method.
3. Commit the transaction.
4. Close the `EntityManager` and `EntityManagerFactory`.

```java
EntityTransaction transaction = entityManager.getTransaction();
transaction.begin();
        
entityManager.persist(employee);  // Updates the existing entity in the database.
        
transaction.commit();
entityManager.close();
entityManagerFactory.close();
```

## How JPA Identifies an Existing Entity

When using `persist()`, JPA checks if the entity already exists in the database:
- It looks at the **primary key** of the entity.
- If the entity exists (i.e., the primary key is present in the database), it updates the record instead of inserting a new one.

---

## Key Points

- Always start a **transaction** for update operations.
- JPA uses the **primary key** to determine if the entity already exists in the database.
- Closing the `EntityManager` and `EntityManagerFactory` is necessary to release resources.
