### **Using Transactions for Read-Only Operations in Spring**

---

### **Scenario: Avoiding Race Conditions in Read Operations**

When reading multiple entities in sequence (e.g., retrieving data for multiple tables), there can be a potential **race condition**:
- The state of the database might change between successive reads.
- This could result in inconsistent data being fetched.

#### **Solution: Use a Transaction for Read-Only Operations**
To ensure consistency during read operations, you can use Spring's `@Transactional` annotation with `readOnly = true`. This ensures that all read operations are part of a single transaction.

### **Example: Read-Only Transaction**

```java
@Service
public class ReportService {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    @Autowired
    private AccessCardRepository accessCardRepository;

    @Transactional(readOnly = true)
    public Report generateEmployeeReport(int employeeId) {
        // Fetch Employee
        Employee employee = employeeRepository.findById(employeeId)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Employee not found"));

        // Fetch Access Card
        AccessCard accessCard = accessCardRepository.findById(employee.getCardId())
                .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Access Card not found"));

        // Combine data into a Report object
        Report report = new Report();
        report.setEmployeeName(employee.getName());
        report.setAccessCardNumber(accessCard.getCardNumber());

        return report;
    }
}
```

### **Key Benefits of `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`**

1. **Consistency**:
   - Ensures all reads occur within the same transaction context.
   - Prevents changes to the database state during the transaction.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - The underlying transaction mechanism recognizes it as a **read-only transaction**.
   - Some optimizations can occur:
     - Disabling dirty checks (since no updates are happening).
     - Reducing the overhead of locking mechanisms in the database.

3. **Non-Blocking Nature**:
   - `readOnly = true` transactions are **not blocking** and allow other operations (including writes) to proceed concurrently.

### **When to Use Read-Only Transactions**

- **Complex Reads**:
  - When fetching multiple entities across repositories and consistency is critical.

- **Reports**:
  - Generating reports or dashboards where the data must remain consistent during generation.

- **Batch Read Operations**:
  - Large-scale data retrieval tasks where database state consistency matters.

---

### **Things to Keep in Mind**

1. **Not a Locking Mechanism**:
   - `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` does **not lock** data.
   - If the database is updated by another process during the transaction, the changes will be visible within the same transaction unless the database itself handles isolation.

2. **Database Behavior Depends on Isolation Level**:
   - The consistency of read data still depends on the **isolation level** of the transaction.
   - For stricter consistency, use higher isolation levels like **REPEATABLE READ** or **SERIALIZABLE**, but this may come with performance trade-offs.

3. **Must Be Used with Transactions**:
   - The `readOnly = true` flag is effective only when the method is part of a transactional context.
