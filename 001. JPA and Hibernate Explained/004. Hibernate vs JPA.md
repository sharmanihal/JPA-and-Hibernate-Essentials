### Understanding the Difference:



Think of it with this analogy:

- **JPA**: Like a Java interface (a blueprint for APIs).

- **Hibernate**: An implementation class of that interface.



Hibernate is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that knows how to perform ORM operations.

### How to Use Hibernate:



1. Add the Hibernate library to your classpath.

2. Map your classes to database tables.

3. Map your member variables to the columns of the table.

4. Use Hibernate APIs to save, update, or retrieve data.



#### Mapping in Hibernate:

- Use Java annotations to map classes and their properties to corresponding database tables and columns.



**Example Workflow:**  

1. Define entity classes.  

2. Annotate the classes and fields for mapping.  

3. Use Hibernate APIs to handle database operations.

### Role of Hibernate in Application Architecture:



In an application, Hibernate acts as a layer between your application and JDBC.  

- It automates all the JDBC calls based on the mappings provided.

### Why JPA Was Introduced:



- Hibernate is just **one** ORM solution, and there are other implementations as well.  

- **JPA** was introduced to standardize ORM mappings so that developers are not tied to a single ORM implementation.

- If Hibernate were discontinued tomorrow, applications using JPA could easily switch to another JPA-compliant implementation without major changes.



**Popular JPA Implementations:**  

1. Hibernate.  

2. EclipseLink.  

3. OpenJPA.

### Conclusion:



- **JPA** provides a standard and flexible API for ORM.  

- **Hibernate** is a specific implementation of the JPA specification.  

- By using JPA, you ensure portability and flexibility while benefiting from Hibernate's powerful ORM capabilities.
