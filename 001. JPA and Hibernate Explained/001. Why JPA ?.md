# Why Learn JPA?

### Widely Used

The thing about enterprise applications is that they connect to the database. 
The database, most of the time, is a relational database (RDBMS).

When you look at Java applications, the most widely used way to connect to RDBMS is using **JPA**. 
An alternative is called **JDBC**, which is considered low-level and primitive.

### Common Scenarios for Using JPA:

1. **Spring Boot Applications for Databases** (Most popular choice).
2. **Java/Jakarta EE Applications** with database integration.
3. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - Each service has its own database.
   - Smaller apps or services could be Spring Boot or Jakarta EE applications.
4. **Desktop and Mobile Applications** (less widely used).
