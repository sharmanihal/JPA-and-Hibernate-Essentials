# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and JPA

### How a Standard Java Application Connects to a Database:

1. **JDBC Drivers**: Used to connect to the database.
2. **Data Access Service**: Accesses data using these drivers.
3. **DAO (Data Access Objects)**: Instances of objects that contain database data.

### Typical Flow of a Java Application:

- **Business Service** → Makes a call to the Data Service.
- **Data Service** → Connects to the database using JDBC drivers and fetches data.
- Data Service then packs the data into DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and returns it to the Business Service.

### JPA's Role in Data Interaction:

JPA replaces the interaction between the **Data Service** and **JDBC**. Instead of using JDBC, JPA allows developers to use API calls, which simplifies database operations.

### Why Use JPA?

#### Mismatch Between Java Classes and Database Tables:

- **Relational World**: Data is stored as rows in tables.
- **Java World**: Data is represented as objects.

**Example: Employee Data**

- A single **row in a database table** corresponds to an **Employee object** in Java.

#### Problems Without JPA (Manual Mapping):

**Read Operation**:
1. Prepare an SQL query.
2. Run the query.
3. Retrieve a result set.
4. Loop through the result set and create Java objects for each row.
5. Extract each column's data and assign it to the object's properties.
6. Collect the objects in a list.
7. Handle errors.

**Write Operation**:
1. Extract object attributes.
2. Prepare an SQL query.
3. Manage keys and relationships.
4. Run the query.
5. Manage transactions.
6. Handle errors.

Without JPA, developers must manually map Java objects to relational tables and vice versa.

### How JPA Solves This Problem:

- Provides annotations to map Java properties to database columns.
- Handles the creation of objects from database rows automatically.
- Ensures each instance of a Java class corresponds to a row in the table.

**Example of Mapping**:
- Java's `Employee` class with a property `address` can map to a separate `Address` table in the database.
- JPA manages complex relationships like foreign keys and composite tables automatically.

---

### Impedance Mismatch in ORM:

- **Scenario 1**: Employee table has a foreign key to the Address table.
  - In Java: `address` is just a property in the `Employee` class. Where Address is a seprate class.
  - In the database: `Employee` and `Address` are separate tables with a foreign key relationship.

- **Scenario 2**: Employee-Manager Relationship.
  - In Java: `manager` is a property in the `Employee` class (self-referential).
  - In the database: A foreign key in the `Employee` table refers to the `Manager`.


### How JPA Helps:

- JPA provides APIs and annotations to define and manage these relationships seamlessly.
- Automatically maps Java properties to database relationships.

JPA bridges the gap between how data is represented in Java and relational databases, making development faster, easier, and less error-prone.
