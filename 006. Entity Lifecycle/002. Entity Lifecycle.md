# Persistence Context in JPA

### What is a Persistence Context?

A **Persistence Context** is like a cache that stores your entity instances managed by JPA. The JPA provider (e.g., Hibernate) uses this context to interact with the database efficiently.

The **Persistence Context** works with the database to store and fetch data, and the JPA provider determines the most optimal way to handle this interaction.

### How Does It Work?

1. **Persisting an Entity:**

   When you call `entityManager.persist(employee)`, the entity is added to the persistence context. However, **an insert statement is not executed immediately**.

2. **Finding an Entity:**

   If you use `entityManager.find(Employee.class, id)` for the same entity, the persistence context provides the reference to the entity already stored in it. No database query is executed.

# Entity States in JPA

Entities in JPA go through multiple states during their lifecycle. Here's a breakdown of these states:

---

## 1. **Transient State**

An entity typically starts in a **transient state**. This means the entity has been created, but no JPA-related operations have been performed on it.

Example:

```java
Employee employee1 = new Employee();
employee1.setName("Bob Marley 2");
employee1.setDob(new Date());
employee1.setEmployeeType(EmployeeType.FULLTIME);
```

- The `employee1` object here is in the **transient state**.
- It is not associated with any persistence context, and no database record exists for it yet.

---

## 2. **Managed State**

When you **persist** an entity, it transitions to the **managed state**. This means:

- JPA starts managing the entity.
- The entity is added to the **persistence context**.
- Changes to the entity are tracked and synchronized with the database when the transaction is committed.

### Example Flow:

1. Persisting an Entity:

```java
entityManager.persist(employee1);
```

At this point, the entity moves to the managed state.

2. The entity is now in the persistence context but might not yet be inserted into the database until the transaction is committed:

### Managed State via Fetching:

If an entity is fetched from the database using methods like `entityManager.find()` or `entityManager.createQuery()`, it also enters the **managed state**. 

Example:

```java
Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1);
```

- The fetched `employee` entity is in the managed state and is part of the persistence context.
- JPA will synchronize changes to this entity back to the database at the end of the transaction.

# Remove, Flush, and Detached States

---

## 1. **Removed State**

An entity transitions to the **removed state** when the `remove()` method is called on a managed entity. This marks the entity for deletion in the database.

### Example:
```java
Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1); // Managed state
EntityTransaction transaction = entityManager.getTransaction();
transaction.begin();
entityManager.remove(employee); // Transition to removed state
transaction.commit();
```

Key Points:
- The entity remains in the persistence context but is no longer managed.
- Changes to this entity won't be synchronized with the database.
- If `find()` is called before the commit, a new SQL query is executed since the entity is not fetched from the persistence context.

### Reverting the Removal:
If removal was accidental, you can bring the entity back to the managed state by calling `persist()` again.

---

## 2. **Flushing the Persistence Context**

Flushing ensures that all changes in the persistence context (both managed and removed entities) are synchronized with the database.

### Example:
```java
entityManager.flush();
```

Key Points:
- Managed entities are updated in the database.
- Removed entities are deleted from the database.
- Flushing does not end the transaction; it only synchronizes the persistence context with the database.

## 3. **Detached State**

An entity transitions to the **detached state** when it is no longer associated with the persistence context. This is not the same as deletion; the database record still exists.

### Example:
```java
entityManager.detach(employee);
```

Key Points:
- The entity is removed from the persistence context.
- The entity won't be synchronized with the database.
- Any modifications made to the detached entity won't be tracked by JPA.

---

## 4. **Reattaching Detached Entities**

You can bring a detached entity back to the managed state using `merge()`. 

### Example:
```java
entityManager.merge(employee); // employee is detached
```

### Why `merge()` and not `persist()`?
- `persist()` creates a new entry in the persistence context, but `merge()` is used when an entity might already exist in the database.
- If another instance of the same entity is already in the persistence context, `merge()` will combine the data from the detached entity into the managed instance.
