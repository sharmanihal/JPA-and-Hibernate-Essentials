# Persistence Context in JPA

### What is a Persistence Context?

A **Persistence Context** is a set of managed entity instances in JPA. These entities are associated with the EntityManager, which is used to perform database operations like `persist`, `merge`, `find`, etc.

The **Persistence Context** is created when an `EntityManager` is instantiated, and it holds the state of the entities. This context is automatically synchronized with the underlying database when changes are committed through the transaction.

### Example: Persisting an Entity

Let's go through an example of persisting an `Employee` entity and understanding the concept of **Persistence Context** in JPA.

#### Code Example

```java
Employee employee1 = new Employee();
employee1.setName("Bob Marley");
employee1.setDob(new Date());
employee1.setEmployeeType(EmployeeType.FULLTIME);

System.out.println("******* Created a new Employee Instance");

EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("myApp");
EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
EntityTransaction transaction = entityManager.getTransaction();

transaction.begin();
System.out.println("******* Staring the transaction");
entityManager.persist(employee1);
System.out.println("******* After persist method call");
transaction.commit();
System.out.println("******* Commiting the transaction");
```

#### Output:

```
******* Created a new Employee Instance
******* Staring the transaction
Hibernate: 
    call next value for hibernate_sequence
******* After persist method call
Hibernate: 
    insert 
    into
        EMPLOYEE_DATA
        (accessCard_id, dob, employeeType, name, id) 
    values
        (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
******* Commiting the transaction
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1:** A new `Employee` instance is created.
- **Step 2:** The `EntityManager` is created using `EntityManagerFactory`.
- **Step 3:** A transaction is started.
- **Step 4:** The `employee1` is persisted using `entityManager.persist()`. However, no insert is executed yet. The `persist` method just adds the entity to the **Persistence Context** (which is an in-memory cache).
- **Step 5:** The `insert` statement is only executed when the transaction is committed (`transaction.commit()`).

This delay in the actual insert statement happens because JPA waits for the transaction to be committed. The persistence context holds the entity and knows when to optimize the database operations. Thus, the actual SQL insert query is executed at the time of commit.

### Finding Entities Before Commit

What happens if you try to fetch the `employee` before committing the transaction? Letâ€™s try it:

```java
transaction.begin();
System.out.println("******* Staring the transaction");
entityManager.persist(employee1);

// Let's try to find the employee before the commit
Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1);
System.out.println(employee);

System.out.println("******* After persist method call");
transaction.commit();
System.out.println("******* Commiting the transaction");
```

#### Output:

```
******* Staring the transaction
Hibernate: 
    call next value for hibernate_sequence
Employee{id=1, name='Bob Marley', dob=Mon Dec 09 12:02:04 IST 2024, employeeType=FULLTIME, accessCard=null}
******* After persist method call
Hibernate: 
    insert 
    into
        EMPLOYEE_DATA
        (accessCard_id, dob, employeeType, name, id) 
    values
        (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
******* Commiting the transaction
```

### Explanation

- Even though the `insert` query has not been executed yet, the `find` method doesn't query the database for the entity.
- **Persistence Context**: The entity manager holds the entity instance in the persistence context, and when you try to access the `employee` using `entityManager.find()`, it provides the entity from the cache instead of querying the database.
- This is because JPA manages an in-memory cache of all managed entities within the **Persistence Context**.

### Verifying the Same Entity Instance

You can verify that the same instance is being returned from the persistence context by comparing the references:

```java
entityManager.persist(employee1);

Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 1);
System.out.println(employee == employee1); // Prints true
```

#### Explanation:

- The above line prints `true` because the `employee1` that was persisted is the same instance that is returned when you call `entityManager.find()` before the transaction is committed.
- This shows that JPA does not need to fetch the entity from the database since it's already in the persistence context.

### Conclusion

- **Persistence Context**: It is the in-memory cache that JPA uses to track the entities and their state. When you call methods like `persist`, JPA does not immediately write to the database but instead holds the entity in the persistence context until the transaction is committed.
- **Optimized Database Operations**: By managing the entities in memory and delaying database operations until the transaction commit, JPA optimizes the use of database resources.
- **Entity Identity**: The entity manager ensures that there is only one instance of each entity per persistence context, providing efficient access and preventing multiple database queries.
