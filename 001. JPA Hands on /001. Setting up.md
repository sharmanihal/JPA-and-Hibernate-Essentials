# Setting Up a JPA Implementation

### Types of JPA Projects:

1. **Using Spring/Spring Boot Integration**:  
   - Provides high-level abstractions for JPA.  
   - Simplifies setup but hides much of JPA's internal workings.

2. **Using Java EE/Jakarta EE Server**:  
   - Similar to Spring Boot, offers abstractions over JPA.

### Why Understand JPA with Barebones Java?

Frameworks provide convenience but hide the "magic" of how JPA works. To fully understand JPA, setting it up in a simple Java project is recommended.

### Steps to Set Up JPA in a Barebones Java Project:

1. **Create a Simple Java Project**:

2. **Add JPA Libraries as Maven Dependencies**:
   - Include dependencies for a JPA implementation (e.g., Hibernate) in the `pom.xml` file.

3. **Configure Database Connection**
  
4. **Perform Entity-Relationship Mapping**:
   - Define entity classes and annotate them with JPA annotations.

5. **Use JPA API to Persist an Entity Instance**:


### Summary:

This approach sets up JPA in a minimalistic way, without relying on frameworks.  
By following these steps, you will understand the core functionality of JPA and its interaction with the database.
